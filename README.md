# ZNC Modules
These are a collection of ZNC modules that I've created for friends or to experiment with the ZNC C++ API.

## Modules
* RegisteredChanMod - Created for [MAGIC](https://github.com/MAGICCC) based on znc/znc#1344
* CapMod - Created as a test for enabling [IRCv3 Specs](http://ircv3.net/irc/) without modifying internal ZNC code. Currently WIP.
